This is the LORA model of llama2 based PhenoGPT. Please acquire llama-2-7b-chat base model first to implement this lora model. (you can apply for the access to the llama2 base model following this [instruction](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/llama2))

After you download the weights and tokenizers from Meta, you should convert to HF version. You can follow this [guidance](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes) to set it up. This approach is preferable; however, it requires you have a large available CPU RAM (100GB) to do the conversion. You should submit a job on HPC to get this done. Alternatively, you can download the llama-2-7b-chat-hf model from [HuggingFace website](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)
